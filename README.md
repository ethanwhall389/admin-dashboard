This is a project that I competed for The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS course. It's purpose was to test students' skills using CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox. I was given a base image to model the site after, but all of the markup and styling had to be figured out independantly. This page does not hold any functionality (other than a sweet dark mode option!) as the project objective was purely stylistic. I had a great time with this project and look forward to using Grid and Flexbox together more in the future.
